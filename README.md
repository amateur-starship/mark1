The purpose of this repository is to serve as a collaboration place to collectively design an amateur spacecraft. The emphasis of this project is in breakthrough technologies like antigravity and free energy.

The design is intended to proceed in two phases:
1) conceptual design
2) detailed design

Anyone can contribute with ideas and suggestions.
