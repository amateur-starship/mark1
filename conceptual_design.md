## Functional Description

The spacecraft (s/c) works by periodically performing the following functions:

Step 1 (motor/aerodynamic phase) [electric energy -> mechanical energy]: The central electromagntes fire up sequentially, accelerating the rotating hull. In this step the s/c works basically as an induction motor plus Coanda effect to provide some lift. 

Step 2 (generator phase): All the central electromagnets switch on, creating a high electric potential between the inner and outer edges of the rotating hull, and decreasing its angular velocity. In this step the s/c works basically as a Faraday disc.

Step 3 (capacitor/electrogravitic phase): the outer edge of the rotating hull is electrically connected to the central electrode, wich thus becomes positively charged, while the rotating hull aquires a negative charge. In this step the s/c works as a T.T.Brown asymmetrical capacitor that produces some extra lift.

The stored energy in the capacitor is then used in step 1 to start the cycle again.

If the proper resonance is achieved between steps 1 and 2, the s/c can then function as a Bedini motor-generator, converting ambient energy into electrical energy.

Some control has to be implemented to avoid run out conditions, specially if superconductivity is achieved due to decreasing temperature.
